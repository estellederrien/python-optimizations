    "Recently, I introduced 𝟏𝟓 + 𝟏 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐔𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 (here: https://lnkd.in/d5iBxFJJ). As promised, reflecting on my own experience and after gathering feedback from my students, I’m excited to disclose the resources that have truly elevated our learning journeys. If you’ve discovered a resource not on this list that’s made a real insight for you, I’d love to hear about it in the comments!\n",
