    "In probability theory and statistics, a Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic process describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Informally, this may be thought of as, \"What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now.\" \n",

    "datacamp quote: \n",
    "Markov chains have prolific use in mathematics. They are widely used in economics, game theory, \n",
    "in communication theory, genetics and finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "They arise widely in especially Bayesian statistical and information theoretical contexts. \n",
    "When dealing with real-world problems, they are used to postulate solutions to study cruise control systems \n",
    "in motor vehicles, queues or queues of customers arriving at an airport, currency exchange rates, etc. \n",
