# Introduction

Hello, my name is Estelle Derrien, my LinkedIn is https://www.linkedin.com/in/estelle-derrien-ro/
I'm available for work  as a production and O.R medium level engineer. I can alternativly provide some full stack devs with some data science or O.R backends ( Also with drag n drops features ..).

I am creating Mathematical optimizations engineering notebooks from my own examples or from various sources such
as 10 books studies in English language.


Theses notebooks are really useful for companies management, factories management, shops management...

When ready, I will also codes convert them to my online application : www.solvgraph.com , translated to a graphical mode, for an easier use for anyone, without coding.

# Used Tools :
-> Python, Python Pulp, Python Cplex, Python Pyomo, Python Gekko, Excel Solver...

# Latest news : 

01 22 2026 : I have no explanation how A.I can do such clear explanations of things, considering how obscures are books in comparison, or It has be trained on unknown secrets docs. I think about an eventual E.T intervention. 

01 22 2026 : Due to the great help of AI : ChatpGtp, DeepSeek, Gemini and Claude will help me do way much more faster everything, and study faster, it is a revolution for my studies notebooks .
I still need to compare results between them, check maths models and their relationships to the python given code, but this AI technology works well.

06 01 2025 : ChatGpt AI and Gemini AI will permit me to finish my ODE differentials equations notebook real fast, Most of the Supply chain metrics, Probabilities, Monte Carlo simuations, Markov Chains, Robotics diff equations,  M.L maths, can now be instantly A.I summarized,  also including the python code.  I also have a LinkedIn Abdel Yezza great Math model Machine learning recapitulative . A.I will also help for my 'Physical measures' directory ( Electricity, resistance of materials...), and DCG Comptability as well . Gemini A.I summarize way faster than me, then I own all of the school books to verify it's ok . It leads me to create any data science app way much faster. About O.R, ChatGtp and Gemini seems to provide good codes. O.R are prescriptives maths, so that's what I prefer.

Here is a MAJOR Lindo non linear optimizations link : 
https://lindo.com/doc/online_help/lingo20_0/index.html?financial_models.htm
I am now able to convert some Lindo optimizations to a Python CPlex optimization, My optimizations skills have really improved and this year will be better ! This is due to my deep maths models analysis I've done past year.
Concerning linear optimizations, I'm still missing some BIGM studies.


10 01 2025 : I am back, some things like " Queues analysis " are already done as my old french notebook but not translated yet. My ideal life would be to add one new example by notebooks each days.

22 06 2025 : Hi guyz, the ideal for me would be to add one new linear or n.l optimization a day, adding one new ODE - diff equation a day, and one new greedy algorithm a day now, but I can't guarantee I will do it.

29/12/2024 : [Matching a Mathematical model to a Python solver code INTRODUCTION STUDY](https://github.com/estellederrien/python-optimizations/blob/main/02.%20Optimizations/02.%20Linear%20combinatorial%20optimizations%20-%20Matching%20a%20mathematical%20model%20to%20a%20solver%20code.ipynb)


27/12/2024 : Hi guyz, I am now using the English language as my first language, ok , let's start by completing my optimizations tutorial " Fitting a maths model to a solver code" notebook, under the Optimizations directory, All of the others  files will then be methodically reviewed and rewritten. Please notice that I can do optimizations in Spanish, and that Operations Research optimizations can be applied to any kind of company, from small to big ones. Doing a book is a waste of time considering piracy. I will also dev the ODEs - Differential equations in Python, at the same time, How exciting is this.

06 12 2024 : I found a way to quickly translate my notebooks with NbConvert to HTML and using the web and the Just one page PDF plug in Chrome. My notebooks in optimization are improving and will become quite good with latex during the year.

04/05/2024 : Ok , I am creating the Management, and <b> unique </b> supply chain notebook, and translating one optimization notebook file a day . Next, will be the <b>unique</b> probabilities rules notebook, then the unique ODE notebook with some real concretes differential equations cases in a production env, then the M.L directory. Next, I will add a <b>unique</b> notebook dedicated to <b>mechanical</b> formulas, and finally, a <b>unique</b> finances notebook file as a conclusion.

09/04/2024 : I will continue both languages at the same time.

02/04/2024 : Finally back on the project, Starting the old french files translations, then, I will go further with more complex optimizations, including Dynamic optimizations. Please allow a few time before I start Translating theses old notebooks from French to English, Don't know If I will translate all of variables too.

# Español

Mi idea era crear mis cuadernos también en español, pero, por falta de tiempo, y porque las optimizaciones son las mismas independientemente del idioma, decidí no publicarlos en español, para centrarme solo en las optimizaciones de procesamiento.

Sin embargo, estoy buscando trabajo en un país hispano y podría traducir todo lo que quieras al español.

Categorías de optimizaciones clásicas utilizando Cplex, Gekko, Pulp, Google o Cvxopt y el solucionador de Excel.
